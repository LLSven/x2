[*] == done	[-] == deprecated	[]  == proposed		[+] == doing


[*]	Remove any cpp file that does not have a coresponding header file.
[*]	DO NOT use multiple implementation files,that means each header file should have at most only corresponding implementation file.For example,List.h had double implementation parts,'List.cpp' and 'SimpleMemoryManager.cpp',now they're combined into 'List.cpp'
[+]	REMOVE any init method,cause the placement new can do that gracefully.
[*]	remove member'size' of LinkedList in List.h
[]	Correct the usage of macro CODE16/CODE32,for there is some code can be used under 64-bit,by cygwin.
[+]	add LinearSpaceManager,which will only keep the free space and complete almost the same function that MemoryManager does.
[]	use policy design style to replace the old extension design style(NOTE:this is and should be only used in Memory Allocation Policy)
[]	set all types that used as boolean but stored with integer to char type.Such as 'allocable' in Memory.
[]	leaving the dormitory,for people there can not work quietly.There is always someone that would encounter to interfer your work.
[]	use bit-structs with #pragma pack... or -fpack-struct=1 to completely redefine the CPU related structs
[]	add a new branch,named "stdc",and laterly a new branch "stdc++".To embed a c & c++ runtime
[]	printf() number()... series
[]	building filesystems so that we start log messages to files
[]	process keyboard interrupt
[+]	repair MemoryManager::withdrawNode()	--	the sons of that nodes shoud be withdrawed also.
[]	printf() series functions
[]	keyboard process functions
