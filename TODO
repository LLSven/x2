[*] == done	[-] == deprecated	[]  == proposed		[+] == doing

[]	Make every class with default constructor declaration.(=default;),and aslo mark a function that deprecated with =delete; '=delete' is strongly different from '__attribute__((deprecated))',because it will not only check call,but also check definition.When it finds such definition,it will stop compliation.
[]	in last commit(2017-03-24 21:20:59),I forgot to refer that I solved the 'circle including problem' when using function macros, by just moving those macros to another file and including them when including the corresponding headers.See folder include/macros.The general usage is that only include macros/all.h is fine to all cases.
[]	mark Util::SEG_CURRENT & enterDs,leaveDs,enterEs,leaveEs are DEPRECATED, use Util::getCurrentDs() instead.
[]	develop virtual memory to make executeables have the ability to access the whole process specified memory.By using that,new memory allocation is done more easily.
	**remember** this problem originates from memory allocation for process,but it has also imported more complicated problems.
[]	techniques are required:
		what is PIE & PIC
			PIE (PI Excuteable)
			PIC (PI Code)
		the only difference between them is that PIC is allowed to inserted symbols(thus it is a shared library).PIE is an executeable and is not used as a library.
		what is flat mode
		
[]	int 0x27 happens but which should have been masked.
		int 0x27 should be irq7.And it is corresponding to parallel port 1 , for printers,and 		if printers are not present,then it is for parallel port.
[]	SimpleMemoryManager	--	Error handling style:
		1.Simplified : pass an error function to it(which accepts this & error code as argument),it will call that handle whenever error condition happened
		2.Unified but complicated: use c++ exception
[]	I think there is a unified way to manage cache-design(cahce level controls) style.
[]	Before this Sunday,write a brief document about how to use gcc/g++ compile system code.(How to write a system in c/c++)(2017-03-09 16:20:33 Thursday)
[*]	Do not use -fpermissive,cause those information are very useful.
		no -fpermissive forces you to:
			1.use this-> on member(functions & variables)
			2.use cast between compitable types
			3.not using default argument in definition
			4.do not use goto.
[*]	It very urgent to develop the hard disk read-write functions cause the size of code is getting bigger and bigger,the maxium(66 sectors) is not going to be able to contain all of them.
[*]	There is a rule called 'avoid using virtual'
[*]	Use eclipse instead of any other editor such as sublime or notepad++,eclipse is the best and the most excellent.
[*]	Remove any cpp file that does not have a coresponding header file.
[*]	DO NOT use multiple implementation files,that means each header file should have at most only corresponding implementation file.For example,List.h had double implementation parts,'List.cpp' and 'SimpleMemoryManager.cpp',now they're combined into 'List.cpp'
[*]	REMOVE any init method,cause the placement new can do that gracefully.
[*]	remove member'size' of LinkedList in List.h
[*]	Correct the usage of macro CODE16/CODE32,for there is some code can be used under 64-bit,by cygwin.
[*]	add LinearSpaceManager,which will only keep the free space and complete almost the same function that MemoryManager does.
[*]	use policy design style to replace the old extension design style(NOTE:this is and should be only used in Memory Allocation Policy)
[*]	set all types that used as boolean but stored with integer or char type.Such as 'allocable' in Memory.
[*]	leaving the dormitory,for people there can not work quietly.There is always someone that would encounter to interfer your work.
[*](2017-03-13 20:28:06)	use bit-structs with #pragma pack... or -fpack-struct=1 to completely redefine the CPU related structs
[]	add a new branch,named "stdc",and laterly a new branch "stdc++".To embed a c & c++ runtime
[]	printf() number()... series
[]	building filesystems so that we start log messages to files
[]	process keyboard interrupt
[+]	repair MemoryManager::withdrawNode()	--	the sons of that nodes shoud be withdrawed also.
[]	printf() series functions
[]	keyboard process functions
