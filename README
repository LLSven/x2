1.There are multiple kinds of codes
	16 only
	32 only
	16,32,64 compitable
if one block of code is only supported by a certain length of bits,say XX,then should CODEXX be defined and encloses that block only if it is defined.
Check the code to see if you have done this.



If two classes does have less or weak or zero connection with each other,do not combine them by explicit usage


This set of work is bound to be working under 64-bit
