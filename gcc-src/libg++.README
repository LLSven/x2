You may have noticed that the libg++ distribution is much smaller than it
used to be.  This is intentional: as of 2.8.0, the supported parts of
libg++ have been split off into the libstdc++ distribution instead.

The remainder of libg++ is only an add-on, and is provided only for
backward compatibility; new programs should avoid using the classes
defined in libg++.  This package is considered obsolete and is no longer
being developed.
