1. If make complains about 'ld',check Makefile+image_xx.ld
2. The template class instantiate will only be valid in the implementation file(.cpp),coz only there exists the definitions.
3. You must be very careful about using library,cause the order must be 'Reference first,Definition then'.Reference first makes the linker keeps the symbol,or it will be abandoned.
4. Header files,cycle dependency?
5. To retrive a Class from just a pointer,call placement new to do that.Or you will get unknown error
