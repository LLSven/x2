1. If make complains about 'ld',check Makefile+image_xx.ld
2. The template class instantiate will only be valid in the implementation file(.cpp),coz only there exists the definitions.
3. You must be very careful about using library,cause the order must be 'Reference first,Definition then'.Reference first makes the linker keeps the symbol,or it will be abandoned.
